# C-BlackJack

This code is a simple implementation of the game of Blackjack in the console using Python. The game consists of dealing cards to a dealer and a player, with the goal of getting as close to 21 points as possible without going over. The code starts by importing the necessary modules, such as 'random' and 'os'. The values of the cards are defined using a dictionary named 'valueCard', and the types of the cards are defined in a list named 'typeCard'. The code includes several functions, including one to get the value of a card, another to count the value of a hand of cards, and one to deal cards to the players. There are also functions to print the hands of the dealer and player, as well as a function to clear the terminal. The main function is called 'play_game', which initiates the game and allows the player to add cards to their hand until they either bust or decide to stay. The code also includes logic to update the dealer's hand and determine the winner of the game.

When implementing the game, the goal was to make it simple and user-friendly. All relevant information, such as the player's and dealer's scores, are displayed clearly on the console for easy viewing. The game also includes error handling for invalid user input.
