# C-BlackJack

This code defines a simple game of blackjack on the console, where the user plays against the dealer. The code first imports necessary modules such as random and os, and then defines the values and types of the cards. The game logic is defined in the function called "play_game", which prompts the user to ask if they are ready to play, deals 2 cards to the dealer and player if the user is ready, prints the dealer's first card and the player's cards, and updates the counts of both. Then, the function prompts the user to ask if they want to add a card, and continues to loop while the user wants to add a card. If the player has busted or won, the game will exit the loop. Finally, the function will print the final result and declare if the player wins or loses the game. The code uses functions such as "deal_cards" to randomly deal cards, "count_cards" to count the value of a hand of cards, and "print_dealer_hand" and "print_player_hand" to print the dealer's and player's hands on the screen. The "clear_terminal" function is used to clear the terminal and update the screen during the game.
